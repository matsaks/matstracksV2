# MatsTracks Vol 2

Skiing and running are fun, but so is keeping track of where youâ€™ve been and what mountain tops youâ€™ve conquered. This application pulls my workouts from the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/), stores them in a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database, and visualizes them on a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) map.

The application is hosted [here](https://matstracks2.vercel.app/). Feel free to take a look! ðŸ˜Š
